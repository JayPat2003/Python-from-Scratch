# Python from Scratch
Welcome to Python from Scratch, a comprehensive repository designed for anyone interested in learning Python programming from the ground up! This project covers all core concepts of Python programming, following the principles of Python 3.12.

The content and code examples are inspired by **"Core Python Programming" by Dr. R. Nageswara Rao**, a popular reference book for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## About the Repository
This repository is built to take you through the essential features of Python, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and file handling. Whether you're a beginner starting your Python journey or someone who wants to reinforce their understanding of the language, you'll find this repository to be a valuable resource.
